# odin-recipes
Before:
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished with this stage, but it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to showcase my knowledge of basic HTML; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
After:
I created an index file and a recipes folder containing three recipe files. I populated the recipe files with recipes from the Quorn website, making minor changes to the content. I did some basic styling, changing the text font to 'Helvetica' and aligning the recipe headers to center, as well as ensuring that the image width is 100%.
